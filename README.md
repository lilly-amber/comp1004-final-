“Passman” is a web-based password account management system. This project aims to produce a secure and easy to use system that manages both passwords and account information. I will be following the stages of the software development lifecycle; I will be using the agile approach to develop this project. The technologies I will be using are HTML for structure,  JavaScript for functionality, and CSS for styling.

Product description
Passman is designed to address the need for effective password management, it provides a secure and simple solution that will allow the user to keep their passwords and account information safe and easy to access with a username and password. (The user will be required to create a passman account to access their specific information.)
The user will open Passman to a login screen where they will input their Passman username and password to access their data. Once logged in, the user will be met with the main dashboard displaying three input containers for the website name, username, and password
When a specific account is clicked on the user will be met with a detailed view of the individual account, including the username, password, and any other information there will also be the option to edit or delete the account. The add account feature will provide fields asking for the kind of account, the username, password and any other information.
the password strength indicator will provide visual feedback on password strength during the passman account creation. It will also provide feedback on passwords the user saves to the database to encourage use of stronger passwords.
The layout will be simple and easy to navigate.
